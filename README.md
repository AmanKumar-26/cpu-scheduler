# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

# Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

# npm start
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
# npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See more about running tests.
# npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
See more about deployment.
# npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!
If you need to customize the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
This command will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) directly into your project, giving you full control.
